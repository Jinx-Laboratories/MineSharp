# MineSharp.Data.Wrapper

MineSharp.Data.Wrapper has some extensions methods and factories to instantiate instances of
the [MineSharp.Data](https://github.com/psu-de/MineSharp/tree/main/Data/MineSharp.Data) classes. \
It also holds manually created window data.

It doesn't really do much and I might get rid of it.
