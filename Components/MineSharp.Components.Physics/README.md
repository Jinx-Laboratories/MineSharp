# MineSharp.Physics

MineSharp.Physics contains the math and logic to simulate entity movements.
Currently only gravity and forward, backward, right, left movement is supported.

A lot of code is from [Alex](https://github.com/ConcreteMC/Alex/) (a minecraft client written in C#)

It's still missing support for:

- Jumping
- Swimming
- Flying
- Vehicles
- (maybe Elytra)
